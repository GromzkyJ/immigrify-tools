## Understanding the Deployment System

### How It Works
1. **Two Branches**: 
   - `test` branch → Auto-deploys to test environment
   - `main` branch → Auto-deploys to production environment

2. **Automatic Deployment**:
   - When you push code to `test` branch → GitHub Actions automatically deploys to test URL
   - When you push code to `main` branch → GitHub Actions automatically deploys to production URL
   - Deployment happens automatically within 1-2 minutes after push

3. **Deployment URLs**:
   - Test Environment: `https://immigrify.ca/tools-test/`
   - Production Environment: `https://immigrify.ca/tools/`

### Important Rules
- ✅ **ALWAYS** test on `test` branch first before deploying to production
- ✅ **ALWAYS** verify test deployment works before merging to `main`
- ✅ **NEVER** push directly to `main` branch without testing first
- ✅ **ALWAYS** use descriptive commit messages

---

## Prerequisites Check

Before deploying, verify you have:

### Required Information
- [ ] GitHub repository URL: `https://github.com/GromzkyJ/immigrify-tools`
- [ ] GitHub Personal Access Token (with `repo` and `workflow` permissions)
- [ ] Access to the project directory: `/Users/maplelyf/Desktop/Immigrify Tools/immigrify-tools`
- [ ] Git is installed and configured

### Verify Git Configuration
```bash
# Check if you're in the correct project directory
pwd

# Verify git is initialized
git status

# Check current branch
git branch

# Verify remote is configured
git remote -v
```

**Expected Output**: You should see:
- Current directory is your project folder
- Git status shows repository information
- Current branch is either `test` or `main`
- Remote URL points to your GitHub repository

### Verify GitHub Authentication
If you haven't set up SSH keys, you'll need to use your Personal Access Token for authentication.

**To check if you need authentication:**
```bash
# Try to fetch (this will fail if not authenticated, which is fine)
git fetch origin
```

If authentication is needed, you'll use the token in the remote URL when pushing (see deployment steps below).

---

## Deploying to Test Environment

### Step-by-Step Process

#### Step 1: Ensure You're on Test Branch
```bash
# Check current branch
git branch

# If you're on a different branch, switch to test
git checkout test

# If test branch doesn't exist locally, create it and track remote
git checkout -b test
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/test test
```

**Verification**: The output should show `* test` indicating you're on the test branch.

#### Step 2: Make Your Changes
- Edit files in your project
- Add new files if needed
- Remove files if needed
- Make sure all changes are saved

#### Step 3: Check What Has Changed
```bash
# See which files have been modified
git status

# See the actual changes made
git diff
```

**Review the changes carefully** to ensure they are what you intended.

#### Step 4: Stage Your Changes
```bash
# Stage all changes
git add .

# OR stage specific files
git add path/to/file1.js path/to/file2.css

# Verify what's staged
git status
```

**Expected Output**: Files listed under "Changes to be committed" should be the files you want to deploy.

#### Step 5: Commit Your Changes
```bash
# Commit with a descriptive message
git commit -m "Description of what you changed and why"

# Examples of good commit messages:
# git commit -m "Add user authentication feature"
# git commit -m "Fix mobile responsive layout for dashboard"
# git commit -m "Update API endpoint configuration"
```

**Important**: 
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Each commit should represent a logical unit of work
- Avoid vague messages like "fix" or "update"

#### Step 6: Authenticate and Push to Test Branch
```bash
# Replace YOUR_TOKEN with your actual GitHub Personal Access Token
# For immigrify.ca project:
# - Username: GromzkyJ
# - Repository: immigrify-tools

git remote set-url origin https://YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/GromzkyJ/immigrify-tools.git

# Push to test branch
git push origin test

# IMPORTANT: Remove token from URL after pushing (security)
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/GromzkyJ/immigrify-tools.git
```

**Example** (for immigrify.ca project):
```bash
git remote set-url origin https://YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/GromzkyJ/immigrify-tools.git
git push origin test
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/GromzkyJ/immigrify-tools.git
```

**Expected Output**: 
```
Enumerating objects: X, done.
Counting objects: 100% (X/X), done.
Delta compression using up to X threads
Compressing objects: 100% (X/X), done.
Writing objects: 100% (X/X), X.XX KiB | X.XX MiB/s, done.
Total X (delta X), reused X (delta X), pack-reused X
To https://github.com/username/repository.git
   abc1234..def5678  test -> test
```

#### Step 7: Verify Deployment Started
1. Go to your GitHub repository in a web browser
2. Click the "Actions" tab
3. You should see a new workflow run with status "In progress" or a yellow circle
4. Click on the workflow run to see details

**What to Look For**:
- Workflow name: "Deploy to Production" (or similar)
- Status: Yellow circle (in progress) or green checkmark (completed)
- Branch: Should show "test"
- Latest run should be from just now (1-2 minutes ago)

#### Step 8: Wait for Deployment to Complete
- Deployment typically takes 1-2 minutes
- Refresh the GitHub Actions page to see updated status
- Look for green checkmark indicating success

**Success Indicators**:
- Green checkmark next to workflow run
- All steps show green checkmarks
- No error messages in the logs

#### Step 9: Verify Test Deployment is Live
1. Wait 1-2 minutes after GitHub Actions shows success
2. Open your web browser
3. Navigate to: `https://immigrify.ca/tools-test/`
4. Verify:
   - Page loads without errors
   - Your changes are visible
   - No console errors (check browser developer tools: F12)
   - All functionality works as expected

**If the page doesn't show your changes**:
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
- Wait another minute (deployment might still be propagating)
- Check GitHub Actions logs for any errors

---

## Deploying to Production Environment

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Always Test First

**NEVER deploy to production without testing on test environment first!**

### Step-by-Step Process

#### Step 1: Verify Test Deployment is Working
Before proceeding, you MUST:
- [ ] Have successfully deployed to test environment
- [ ] Verified test site works correctly at `https://immigrify.ca/tools-test/`
- [ ] Tested all functionality on test site
- [ ] Confirmed no errors or issues
- [ ] Reviewed all changes one more time

**If ANY of the above are not true, DO NOT proceed to production deployment.**

#### Step 2: Switch to Main Branch
```bash
# Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Verify you're on main branch
git branch
```

**Expected Output**: Should show `* main` indicating you're on the main branch.

#### Step 3: Pull Latest Changes from Main (Safety Check)
```bash
# Fetch latest changes from remote
git fetch origin

# Check if main branch has any new commits
git log HEAD..origin/main

# If there are new commits, pull them first
git pull origin main
```

**Why This Matters**: Ensures you're working with the latest production code and won't overwrite someone else's changes.

#### Step 4: Merge Test Branch into Main
```bash
# Merge test branch into main
git merge test

# If there are merge conflicts, resolve them:
# 1. Git will show which files have conflicts
# 2. Open those files and resolve conflicts manually
# 3. After resolving, run: git add .
# 4. Then run: git commit (Git will use default merge message)
```

**Expected Output** (if no conflicts):
```
Updating abc1234..def5678
Fast-forward
 file1.js | 10 ++++++++++
 file2.css |  5 +++++
 2 files changed, 15 insertions(+)
```

**If You See Merge Conflicts**:
```
Auto-merging file.js
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in file.js
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

**How to Resolve Conflicts**:
1. Open the conflicted file(s) in your editor
2. Look for conflict markers: `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`
3. Choose which version to keep (or combine both)
4. Remove the conflict markers
5. Save the file
6. Run: `git add .`
7. Run: `git commit` (use default message or add your own)

#### Step 5: Verify Merge Was Successful
```bash
# Check git status
git status
```

**Expected Output**: Should show "Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by X commits" with no unmerged paths.

#### Step 6: Push to Main Branch (Production Deployment)
```bash
# Authenticate with token
git remote set-url origin https://YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/GromzkyJ/immigrify-tools.git

# Push to main branch (THIS DEPLOYS TO PRODUCTION)
git push origin main

# IMPORTANT: Remove token from URL after pushing
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/GromzkyJ/immigrify-tools.git
```

**Example** (for immigrify.ca):
```bash
git remote set-url origin https://YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/GromzkyJ/immigrify-tools.git
git push origin main
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/GromzkyJ/immigrify-tools.git
```

**Expected Output**: Similar to test push, but deploying to main branch.

#### Step 7: Verify Production Deployment Started
1. Go to GitHub repository → "Actions" tab
2. You should see a new workflow run
3. Verify:
   - Branch shows "main" (not "test")
   - Status is "In progress" or completed
   - Workflow name is correct

#### Step 8: Wait for Production Deployment
- Wait 1-2 minutes for deployment to complete
- Monitor GitHub Actions for completion
- Look for green checkmark

#### Step 9: Verify Production Site is Live
1. Wait 1-2 minutes after GitHub Actions shows success
2. Open your web browser
3. Navigate to: `https://immigrify.ca/tools/`
4. Verify:
   - Page loads correctly
   - All changes from test are now in production
   - Everything works as expected
   - No errors in browser console

#### Step 10: Post-Deployment Verification Checklist
- [ ] Production site loads without errors
- [ ] All new features work correctly
- [ ] No broken links or missing resources
- [ ] Mobile view works (if applicable)
- [ ] Forms submit correctly (if applicable)
- [ ] No console errors in browser
- [ ] Performance is acceptable

## Deploying React Applications

### Understanding React App Deployment

React applications require a build step before deployment. The workflow automatically:
1. Detects React apps (folders with `package.json`)
2. Installs dependencies (`npm install`)
3. Builds the app (`npm run build`)
4. Deploys the `build/` folder contents

### React App Structure Requirements

Your React app folder must have:
```
your-react-app/
├── package.json          # Required - must have "build" script
├── src/                  # React source files
├── public/               # Public assets (index.html, etc.)
└── .gitignore           # Should exclude node_modules and build
```

### Deploying a New React App

#### Step 1: Create React App Folder
```bash
# Navigate to project root
cd /path/to/Tools

# Create folder for React app
mkdir my-react-app
cd my-react-app
```

#### Step 2: Initialize React App
```bash
# Create package.json
npm init -y

# Install React dependencies
npm install react react-dom react-scripts

# Create folder structure
mkdir -p src public
```

#### Step 3: Set Up package.json
Ensure `package.json` has:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "react-scripts build"
  }
}
```

#### Step 4: Test Build Locally (Recommended)
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Test build
npm run build

# Verify build folder was created
ls build/
```

#### Step 5: Commit and Deploy
```bash
# Go back to project root
cd ..

# Add React app
git add my-react-app/
git commit -m "Add React app: my-react-app"
git remote set-url origin https://YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/GromzkyJ/immigrify-tools.git
git push origin test
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/GromzkyJ/immigrify-tools.git
```

#### Step 6: Monitor Build Process
1. Go to GitHub → Actions tab
2. Watch the workflow run
3. Look for "Build React Apps" step
4. Verify your app appears in the build log
5. Wait for deployment to complete (2-5 minutes for React apps)

#### Step 7: Verify Deployment
Visit: `https://immigrify.ca/tools-test/my-react-app/`

### Updating an Existing React App

#### Step 1: Make Changes
```bash
# Navigate to your React app folder
cd my-react-app

# Make your changes
# Edit files in src/, etc.
```

#### Step 2: Test Locally (Recommended)
```bash
# Test the app locally
npm start

# Or test the build
npm run build
```

#### Step 3: Commit and Deploy
```bash
# Go back to project root
cd ..

# Commit changes
git add my-react-app/
git commit -m "Update React app: description of changes"
git remote set-url origin https://YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/GromzkyJ/immigrify-tools.git
git push origin test
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/GromzkyJ/immigrify-tools.git
```

### Migrating an Existing React App

If you have an existing React app (like blockchain authentication):

#### Step 1: Prepare Your App
```bash
# Ensure your app builds successfully
cd /path/to/your/existing-react-app
npm install
npm run build

# Verify build folder exists
ls build/
```

#### Step 2: Copy to Tools Directory
```bash
# Copy your app to Tools directory
cp -r /path/to/your/existing-react-app /path/to/Tools/blockchain-auth

# Or move it
mv /path/to/your/existing-react-app /path/to/Tools/blockchain-auth
```

#### Step 3: Verify Structure
```bash
cd /path/to/Tools/blockchain-auth

# Check required files exist
ls package.json    # Must exist
ls src/            # Must exist
ls public/          # Should exist
```

#### Step 4: Update .gitignore
Ensure `.gitignore` excludes:
```
node_modules/
build/
.env
```

#### Step 5: Commit and Deploy
```bash
cd /path/to/Tools

git add blockchain-auth/
git commit -m "Add blockchain authentication React app"
git remote set-url origin https://YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/GromzkyJ/immigrify-tools.git
git push origin test
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/GromzkyJ/immigrify-tools.git
```

### React App Deployment Checklist

Before deploying a React app:
- [ ] `package.json` exists in app folder
- [ ] `package.json` has `"homepage": "."` field (REQUIRED for subdirectory deployment)
- [ ] `package.json` has `"build"` script
- [ ] `src/` folder exists with React code
- [ ] `public/index.html` exists
- [ ] App builds successfully locally (`npm run build`)
- [ ] `.gitignore` excludes `node_modules/` and `build/`
- [ ] All dependencies listed in `package.json`

### React App vs HTML App

| Feature | HTML App | React App |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| Build Required | No | Yes (`npm run build`) |
| Deployment Time | 1-2 minutes | 2-5 minutes |
| Folder Structure | Just HTML files | `src/`, `public/`, `package.json` |
| Dependencies | None | Listed in `package.json` |
| Build Output | Files as-is | `build/` folder contents |

### Important Notes for React Apps

1. **Build Time**: React apps take longer to deploy (2-5 minutes) due to build process
2. **Dependencies**: All dependencies must be in `package.json`
3. **Build Script**: Must have `"build": "react-scripts build"` or equivalent
4. **Build Output**: React apps output to `build/` folder (standard)
5. **No Root package.json**: Don't create `package.json` in root Tools folder
6. **Independent Builds**: Each React app builds independently
7. **Error Handling**: If build fails, deployment stops - check GitHub Actions logs

### Troubleshooting React App Deployment

#### Issue: Build Fails in GitHub Actions
**Symptoms**: Workflow shows error in "Build React Apps" step
**Solutions**:
1. Test build locally: `cd your-app && npm install && npm run build`
2. Check `package.json` has all required dependencies
3. Verify `build` script exists: `"build": "react-scripts build"`
4. Check for syntax errors in React code
5. Review GitHub Actions logs for specific error messages

#### Issue: App Shows Blank Page After Deployment
**Symptoms**: App URL loads but shows blank page
**Solutions**:
1. Check browser console for errors (F12)
2. Verify `public/index.html` has `<div id="root"></div>`
3. Check that `src/index.js` renders the App component
4. Verify all files were deployed (check server via File Manager)
5. Check for JavaScript errors in browser console

#### Issue: CSS/JS Files Return 404 Errors
**Symptoms**: App loads but CSS/JS files show 404 errors in console
**Solutions**:
1. **Most Common Fix**: Add `"homepage": "."` to `package.json` in your React app folder
2. Rebuild the app: `cd your-app && npm run build`
3. Commit and push the updated `package.json`
4. Verify the build output uses relative paths (check `build/index.html` - paths should start with `./` not `/`)
5. If using Create React App, the `homepage` field is required for subdirectory deployment

#### Issue: Dependencies Not Installing
**Symptoms**: Build fails with "module not found" errors
**Solutions**:
1. Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`
2. Check `package-lock.json` is up to date
3. Verify Node.js version compatibility
4. Try deleting `node_modules/` and `package-lock.json`, then `npm install` again

#### Issue: Build Succeeds But App Not Found
**Symptoms**: Build completes but 404 error when accessing app
**Solutions**:
1. Verify app folder name matches URL path
2. Check that `build/` folder was created
3. Verify workflow completed successfully
4. Check server directory structure via File Manager
5. Ensure `build/` folder contents were copied correctly

---

## Verification Steps

### After Every Deployment

#### 1. Check GitHub Actions Status
- Go to: `https://github.com/GromzkyJ/immigrify-tools/actions`
- Verify latest run shows green checkmark
- Click on the run to see detailed logs
- Verify no error messages in logs

#### 2. Check Website Accessibility
- Test URL loads in browser
- No 404 errors
- No 500 errors
- Page renders correctly

#### 3. Check Browser Console
- Open browser developer tools (F12)
- Go to "Console" tab
- Verify no JavaScript errors
- Verify no network errors (404s, etc.)

#### 4. Test Functionality
- Test all interactive features
- Test forms (if any)
- Test navigation (if any)
- Test responsive design on mobile

#### 5. Check File Structure (If Needed)
If something seems wrong, verify files are in correct location:
1. Log into CyberPanel
2. Go to File Manager
3. Navigate to:
   - Test: `public_html/tools-test/`
   - Production: `public_html/tools/`
4. Verify `index.html` and other files are present

---

## Version Management and Rollback

### Understanding Version History

Every commit in Git creates a version snapshot. You can revert to any previous version at any time. This is your safety net when deployments go wrong.

### Viewing Version History

```bash
# See all commits (versions) with their IDs
git log --oneline

# See detailed history with graph
git log --oneline --graph --all --decorate

# See last 10 commits
git log --oneline -10

# See commits for a specific file
git log --oneline -- path/to/file.js
```

**Example Output:**
```
abc1234 (HEAD -> test) Version 3 - Added new feature
def5678 Version 2 - Fixed bug
ghi9012 Version 1 - Initial release
```

### Using Version Tags

Version tags make it easier to identify and revert to specific versions.

#### Creating Version Tags

```bash
# After a successful production deployment, create a tag
git checkout main

# Tag the current version (semantic versioning: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
git tag v1.0.0 -m "Version 1.0.0: Initial production release"
git tag v1.1.0 -m "Version 1.1.0: Added user authentication"
git tag v2.0.0 -m "Version 2.0.0: Major redesign"

# Push tags to GitHub
git push origin --tags
```

#### Viewing Tags

```bash
# List all tags
git tag

# See tags with commit messages
git tag -l -n

# See what changed between versions
git diff v1.0.0 v1.1.0
```

### Rolling Back to a Previous Version

#### Scenario: Version 3 Broke the Site

**Step 1: Identify the Problem Version**
```bash
# See recent commits
git log --oneline -5

# Output:
# abc1234 (HEAD -> test) Version 3 - BROKEN
# def5678 Version 2 - Working
# ghi9012 Version 1 - Working
```

**Step 2: Revert to Previous Working Version (Recommended Method)**

This method creates a new commit that undoes the broken changes, preserving history:

```bash
# Switch to test branch
git checkout test

# Revert the broken commit (creates a new commit that undoes it)
git revert abc1234

# This opens an editor for commit message, or use -m flag:
git revert abc1234 -m "Revert to Version 2: Version 3 caused issues"

# Push the revert to test
git remote set-url origin https://YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/GromzkyJ/immigrify-tools.git
git push origin test
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/GromzkyJ/immigrify-tools.git
```

**Step 3: Verify on Test Environment**
- Wait for deployment to complete
- Check `https://immigrify.ca/tools-test/`
- Verify site is working again

**Step 4: Deploy to Production**
```bash
# Merge to main
git checkout main
git merge test
git remote set-url origin https://YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/GromzkyJ/immigrify-tools.git
git push origin main
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/GromzkyJ/immigrify-tools.git
```

#### Alternative: Revert Using Version Tags

```bash
# 1. See available versions
git tag

# 2. Create a new branch from a previous version
git checkout -b hotfix/rollback-to-v1.0.0 v1.0.0

# 3. Test the rollback
# ... verify everything works ...

# 4. Merge back to test
git checkout test
git merge hotfix/rollback-to-v1.0.0
git push origin test

# 5. Deploy to production
git checkout main
git merge test
git push origin main
```

#### Emergency Rollback (Use with Extreme Caution)

**⚠️ WARNING**: This rewrites history. Only use if:
- You're the only one working on the project
- You need immediate rollback
- You understand this removes commits from history

```bash
# 1. Find the commit hash of the working version
git log --oneline

# 2. Reset to that commit
git checkout test
git reset --hard def5678  # Replace with your commit hash

# 3. Force push (ONLY if absolutely necessary)
git remote set-url origin https://YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/GromzkyJ/immigrify-tools.git
git push origin test --force
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/GromzkyJ/immigrify-tools.git

# 4. Verify, then deploy to production
git checkout main
git reset --hard def5678
git push origin main --force
```

### Version Management Best Practices

#### 1. Tag After Successful Deployments
```bash
# After successful production deployment
git checkout main
git tag v1.2.0 -m "Version 1.2.0: Added payment integration"
git push origin --tags
```

#### 2. Use Semantic Versioning
- **MAJOR** (v2.0.0): Breaking changes
- **MINOR** (v1.1.0): New features, backward compatible
- **PATCH** (v1.0.1): Bug fixes

#### 3. Document Version Changes
Keep a `CHANGELOG.md` file:
```markdown
## [1.2.0] - 2024-01-15
### Added
- Payment integration
- User dashboard

### Fixed
- Login bug on mobile
- Memory leak in API calls
```

#### 4. Test Rollback Procedures
- Periodically test your ability to rollback
- Document the rollback process
- Ensure team knows how to rollback

#### 5. Never Delete Tags
- Tags are permanent markers
- They help identify versions
- Keep them for historical reference

### Quick Rollback Checklist

When you need to rollback:
- [ ] Identify the broken version/commit
- [ ] Identify the last working version
- [ ] Choose rollback method (revert vs reset)
- [ ] Test rollback on test environment first
- [ ] Verify site works after rollback
- [ ] Deploy to production
- [ ] Document what went wrong
- [ ] Tag the rollback version

## Common Deployment Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Deploying a Single File Change

**Situation**: You modified one file and want to deploy it.

**Steps**:
```bash
# 1. Check current branch
git branch

# 2. If not on test, switch to test
git checkout test

# 3. Stage the specific file
git add path/to/file.js

# 4. Commit
git commit -m "Fix bug in file.js"

# 5. Push to test
git remote set-url origin https://YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/GromzkyJ/immigrify-tools.git
git push origin test
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/GromzkyJ/immigrify-tools.git

# 6. Verify on test site, then merge to main
git checkout main
git merge test
git remote set-url origin https://YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/GromzkyJ/immigrify-tools.git
git push origin main
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/GromzkyJ/immigrify-tools.git
```

### Scenario 2: Deploying Multiple Related Changes

**Situation**: You made several changes that work together.

**Steps**:
```bash
# 1. Stage all related files
git add file1.js file2.css file3.html

# 2. Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "Add new feature: user profile page with styling"

# 3. Push and verify (same as Scenario 1)
```

### Scenario 3: Rolling Back a Deployment

**Situation**: You deployed something that broke the site and need to revert.

**Steps**:
```bash
# 1. Find the commit hash before the bad deployment
git log --oneline

# 2. Note the commit hash of the last good version (e.g., abc1234)

# 3. Reset to that commit (CAREFUL: This discards newer commits)
git reset --hard abc1234

# 4. Force push to revert (ONLY if you're sure)
git remote set-url origin https://YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/GromzkyJ/immigrify-tools.git
git push origin main --force
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/GromzkyJ/immigrify-tools.git

# 5. Verify site is working again
```

**⚠️ WARNING**: Force push rewrites history. Only use if absolutely necessary and you're the only one working on the project.

### Scenario 4: Deploying After Someone Else's Changes

**Situation**: Someone else pushed changes while you were working.

**Steps**:
```bash
# 1. Before pushing, pull latest changes
git checkout test
git pull origin test

# 2. If there are conflicts, resolve them (see merge conflict resolution above)

# 3. Then push your changes
git push origin test

# 4. Same process for main branch
```

### Scenario 5: Hotfix - Urgent Production Fix

**Situation**: Critical bug in production needs immediate fix.

**Steps**:
```bash
# 1. Create hotfix branch from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-bug-fix

# 2. Make the fix
# ... edit files ...

# 3. Commit the fix
git add .
git commit -m "Hotfix: Critical bug description"

# 4. Test on test environment first (if possible)
git checkout test
git merge hotfix/critical-bug-fix
git remote set-url origin https://YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/GromzkyJ/immigrify-tools.git
git push origin test
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/GromzkyJ/immigrify-tools.git

# 5. Verify on test site quickly

# 6. Deploy to production
git checkout main
git merge hotfix/critical-bug-fix
git remote set-url origin https://YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/GromzkyJ/immigrify-tools.git
git push origin main
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/GromzkyJ/immigrify-tools.git

# 7. Also merge back to test to keep it in sync
git checkout test
git merge main
git push origin test
```

## Troubleshooting Deployment Issues

### Issue: "Permission denied" when pushing

**Error Message**: 
```
remote: Permission to username/repo.git denied to user.
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/...': The requested URL returned error: 403
```

**Solutions**:
1. **Check Personal Access Token**:
   - Token might have expired
   - Token might not have `repo` permission
   - Regenerate token with correct permissions

2. **Verify Token in Remote URL**:
   ```bash
   # Check current remote URL
   git remote -v
   
   # Update with correct token
   git remote set-url origin https://YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/GromzkyJ/immigrify-tools.git
   ```

3. **Try Using SSH Instead** (if configured):
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin git@github.com:USERNAME/REPO.git
   ```

### Issue: "Workflow not triggering"

**Symptom**: You push code but GitHub Actions doesn't run.

**Solutions**:
1. **Check Workflow File Exists**:
   ```bash
   # Verify workflow file is in correct location
   ls -la .github/workflows/deploy.yml
   ```

2. **Check Branch Name**:
   - Workflow only triggers on `test` and `main` branches
   - Verify you're pushing to correct branch: `git branch`

3. **Check Workflow File Syntax**:
   - Go to GitHub → Actions tab
   - Look for any error messages about workflow syntax
   - Fix any YAML syntax errors

4. **Manually Trigger** (if needed):
   - Go to GitHub → Actions tab
   - Click "Run workflow" button
   - Select branch and run

### Issue: "Deployment succeeded but site shows 404"

**Symptom**: GitHub Actions shows success, but website returns 404.

**Solutions**:
1. **Check File Location**:
   - Log into CyberPanel → File Manager
   - Navigate to `public_html/tools-test/` or `public_html/tools/`
   - Verify `index.html` exists in that directory

2. **Check Server Directory Path**:
   - Review workflow file: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
   - Verify `server-dir` is correct:
     - Test: `./tools-test/`
     - Production: `./tools/`

3. **Check File Permissions** (if needed):
   - In CyberPanel File Manager, check file permissions
   - Should be readable (644 for files, 755 for directories)

4. **Clear Browser Cache**:
   - Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)

### Issue: "Files deployed but changes not visible"

**Symptom**: Deployment succeeded, but old content still shows.

**Solutions**:
1. **Clear Browser Cache**:
   - Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R
   - Or use incognito/private browsing mode

2. **Check Deployment Logs**:
   - Go to GitHub Actions → Click on the workflow run
   - Check "Deploy to Test/Production Environment" step
   - Verify files were actually uploaded

3. **Verify Correct Files Were Committed**:
   ```bash
   # Check what was in the last commit
   git show HEAD --name-only
   ```

4. **Check if Build Process Ran**:
   - If using a build process (React, etc.), verify build step completed
   - Check if `build/` directory has latest files

### Issue: "Merge conflicts when merging test to main"

**Error Message**:
```
Auto-merging file.js
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in file.js
```

**Solution**:
1. **See which files have conflicts**:
   ```bash
   git status
   ```

2. **Open conflicted files** and look for:
   ```
   <<<<<<< HEAD
   (code from main branch)
   =======
   (code from test branch)
   >>>>>>> test
   ```

3. **Resolve conflicts**:
   - Decide which code to keep (or combine both)
   - Remove conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`)
   - Save the file

4. **Mark as resolved**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit
   ```

### Issue: "Deployment takes too long"

**Symptom**: GitHub Actions shows "In progress" for more than 5 minutes.

**Solutions**:
1. **Check GitHub Actions Status**:
   - GitHub might be experiencing issues
   - Check: https://www.githubstatus.com/

2. **Check Workflow Logs**:
   - Click on the workflow run
   - See which step is stuck
   - Look for error messages

3. **Cancel and Retry**:
   - Click "Cancel workflow" if stuck
   - Push again to trigger new deployment

### Issue: "FTP authentication failed in deployment"

**Error Message**: `530 login authentication failed`

**Solutions**:
1. **Verify GitHub Secrets**:
   - Go to GitHub → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
   - Verify all three secrets exist:
     - `FTP_SERVER`
     - `FTP_USERNAME`
     - `FTP_PASSWORD`

2. **Check Secret Values**:
   - Verify FTP username matches exactly what's in CyberPanel
   - Verify FTP password is correct (no extra spaces)
   - Verify FTP server address is correct

3. **Update Secrets if Needed**:
   - Edit secrets in GitHub
   - Re-run the workflow

## Best Practices

### 1. Always Test Before Production
- ✅ Deploy to test environment first
- ✅ Verify everything works on test site
- ✅ Test all functionality thoroughly
- ✅ Check on multiple browsers/devices
- ✅ Only then merge to main for production
- ❌ Never skip testing
- ❌ Never deploy untested code

### 2. Use Descriptive Commit Messages
Follow conventional commit format:
```
type(scope): subject

Examples:
feat(auth): add user login functionality
fix(dashboard): resolve memory leak in widgets
docs(readme): update installation instructions
refactor(api): optimize endpoint responses
```

- ✅ Good: "feat(auth): add user login with email verification"
- ✅ Good: "fix(ui): resolve mobile menu not closing on click"
- ✅ Good: "docs(deploy): update deployment instructions"
- ❌ Bad: "fix"
- ❌ Bad: "update"
- ❌ Bad: "changes"

### 3. Commit Logical Units of Work
- ✅ One feature = one commit
- ✅ One bug fix = one commit
- ✅ Related changes together
- ❌ Don't mix unrelated changes in one commit
- ❌ Don't commit everything at once

### 4. Review Changes Before Committing
```bash
# Always review what you're about to commit
git status          # See what files changed
git diff            # See actual changes
git diff --staged   # See staged changes
```

**Check for:**
- Unintended changes
- Debug code (console.log, etc.)
- Hardcoded credentials
- Unnecessary files

### 5. Keep Test and Main in Sync
After deploying to production, merge main back to test:
```bash
git checkout test
git merge main
git push origin test
```

This ensures test environment reflects production.

### 6. Tag Important Versions
```bash
# After successful production deployment
git checkout main
git tag v1.2.0 -m "Version 1.2.0: Added payment integration"
git push origin --tags
```

### 7. Don't Skip Steps
- ❌ Don't push directly to main
- ❌ Don't skip testing
- ❌ Don't ignore error messages
- ❌ Don't skip code review
- ❌ Don't skip verification

### 8. Monitor Deployments
- ✅ Always check GitHub Actions after pushing
- ✅ Always verify the website after deployment
- ✅ Check browser console for errors
- ✅ Monitor for 5-10 minutes after deployment
- ✅ Check error logs if available

### 9. Document Significant Changes
- ✅ Update CHANGELOG.md for major versions
- ✅ Note breaking changes
- ✅ Document new features
- ✅ Update README if needed
- ✅ Document configuration changes

### 10. Backup Before Major Changes
```bash
# Create backup branch before major changes
git checkout -b backup/before-major-change
git push origin backup/before-major-change

# Or tag current version
git tag backup-before-redesign
git push origin --tags
```

### 11. Communicate with Team
- ✅ Notify team before major deployments
- ✅ Communicate breaking changes
- ✅ Coordinate deployments if multiple people working
- ✅ Update team on deployment status
- ✅ Share rollback plans for major changes

### 12. Version Management
- ✅ Tag versions after successful deployments
- ✅ Use semantic versioning (v1.2.3)
- ✅ Keep version history clean
- ✅ Document version changes
- ✅ Test rollback procedures

### 13. Code Quality
- ✅ Remove debug code before committing
- ✅ Remove console.log statements
- ✅ Remove commented-out code
- ✅ Follow project style guide
- ✅ Keep code organized

### 14. Security
- ✅ Never commit credentials
- ✅ Use GitHub Secrets for sensitive data
- ✅ Review code for security issues
- ✅ Keep dependencies updated
- ✅ Use strong passwords
